* Features List

Feature todo list, priority descending

** Stream behavior should able to handle multiple streams
One process could become the owner of multiple streams in the scenario
that these streams are correlated.

** Impl ConfigurationLoadCredential
Load QUIC_CREDENTIAL_CONFIG to configuration

** Check shutdown connection wait for peer to close or not

** Get/Set Context
with lock protection set/get the callback context.

** New API: open_send(connection_handle(), Data, Flags)
Open stream over this connection and send without starting the stream

** Unintentional Transport Migration

** NIF Segfault recover

** NIF Upgrade

* Improvements

- send buffering

- event masks

  Not all the events are interested by application.

- close handle in worker callback ctx to get less scheduler blockings

- Use imm handle
  Maybe very less performance gain but still worth to change it.

- 0-RTT NST

  stateful and stateless.

- make sending NST configurable

- check types.

- Level of APIs

  Current API are designd to easily migrate from TCP.

  QUIC can provide more detailed error info that a simple {error, Info} cannot hold.

  QUIC can provide more flags while doing any calls

  So we may need different levels of APIs.
  Level 1: Simple and for ease of migration from TCP/TLS
  Level 2: Expose details but with some common generic behaviors
  Level 3: Pure NIF calls, application caller manages everything but also means
           Quicer must be more transparent
